An incredible script capable of generating very secure passwords


### Requirements
```
Python 3
string
io
secrets
```
### How to use
Run the script by double-clicking it or run this command in the console : ```python passwordgenerator.py```

When script opens, he will ask you how many characters you want the password to contain
```
$ How many characters do you want the password to have ?: 8
```

When you have entered the number, a password is automatically generated
```
$ Password generated successfuly : password
```

You can save the password in a text file so as not to lose it
```
$ Do you want save this password in a file ? (Yes or No): Yes
```
You can put a name to your password
```
$ Password name (If you don't want to give it a name, press enter):
```
The file with the generated passwords is created in the same directory as the script.

### **Important**
Saving passwords in a text file is never safe. That is why it is important that once you generate the passwords you need, save them in a password manager or encrypt the file that contains the passwords. I recommend that you use [**KeePass**](https://keepass.info/) as your password manager, it is open source and easy to use.

Please note what I have told you and protect your passwords properly.
